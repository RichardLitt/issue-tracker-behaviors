# Behaviors

## Me too, plus one

User shows up adding no new information, just:

* "+1"
" "me too"
* "i also see this"

No version numbers, no logs, nothing.

User has not learned to use the emoji reactions yet. (Please learn.)

## Subscribing via comments

* "just leaving a comment to watch this bug"

And you just spammed everybody else watching this bug.

There's a "subscribe" button to get notified over on the right. Push
that instead.

## Back from the dead

User comments on ancient closed issue saying they're "also seeing
this", without saying what "this" is. They probably found one common
symptom ("it doesn't work") and decided that an Android crash from 3
years ago is the same as their Windows issues, because both resulted
in it "not working".

## Any update?

* "Any update?"
* "Any news on this?"

If there was an update we would've posted an update. We were just
waiting for the forty seventh person to ask! But now that you're here,
here's an update...

## Any workaround?

User asks for a "workaround" on a bug that clearly has no
workaround. Maybe it's a feature request or a crash that's affecting
nearly everybody, but the user wants to a workaround.

## The negger

* "I can't believe you don't have this yet. That's ridiculous. All
  your competitors can do X, so I guess I'll just have to go use
  something else."
