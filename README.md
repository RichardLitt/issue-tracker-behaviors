# Public Issue Tracker Behaviors

I've been involved in FOSS communities for over 25 years now. I've
used a handful of different bug trackers and worked on and created a
ton projects, often acting as the bug triage person.

I've also worked inside companies with private bug trackers.

Private bug trackers and public bug trackers are vastly
different. Public bug trackers are full of the best and the worst of
the internet. This page documents some of the most commonly seen bad
behavior on public issue trackers. (and why many people prefer private bug
trackers)

Pull requests welcome to add more. I surely forgot a bunch.

# Behaviors

## Me too, plus one

User shows up adding no new information, just:

* "+1"
* "me too"
* "i also see this"

No version numbers, no logs, nothing.

User has not learned to use the emoji reactions yet. (Please learn.)

## Subscribing via comments

* "just leaving a comment to watch this bug"

And you just spammed everybody else watching this bug.

There's a "subscribe" button to get notified over on the right. Push
that instead.

## Back from the dead

User comments on ancient closed issue saying they're "also seeing
this", without saying what "this" is. They probably found one common
symptom ("it doesn't work") and decided that an Android crash from 3
years ago is the same as their Windows issues, because both resulted
in it "not working".

## Any update?

* "Any update?"
* "Any news on this?"

If there was an update we would've posted an update. We were just
waiting for the forty seventh person to ask! But now that you're here,
here's an update...

## Any workaround?

User asks for a "workaround" on a bug that clearly has no
workaround. Maybe it's a feature request or a crash that's affecting
everybody, but the user wants a "workaround".

## The negger

* "I can't believe you don't have this yet. That's ridiculous. All
  your competitors can do X, so I guess I'll just have to go use
  something else."

## The duper

Files duplicate bug without doing any search ahead of time to see if
the bug was already filed. I don't expect people to be perfect and
find a possible dup bug every time, but I expect you to try for 10
seconds first.

## The template ignorer

The bug template asks a bunch of questions.

The person filing the bug answers none of them.

But, uh, "it doesn't work".
